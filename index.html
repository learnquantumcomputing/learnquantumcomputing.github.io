	<h2>What is quantum computing?</h2>
	<p>Quantum computers use the phenomena of quantum physics and mechanics to perform computational operations. Unlike classical computers which perform computations with discrete binary states, quantum computers use superposition states of 0 or 1 to represent fundamental units of data. Superposition, along with entanglement and quantum inteference, make up the quantum phenomena which allow quantum computers to excel in cryptography, quantum simulation, optimization, and searching. </p>
	<h2>Why learn quantum computing?</h2>
	<p>Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology. Within the next decade, there will be a greater demand for engineers and programmers in the quantum computing space.</p>
	<h2>Careers in quantum computing</h2>

	<h2>How to prepare for a career in quantum computing</h2>
	<p>Students learning quantum computing should be well-versed in physics, mathematics, and computer programming. Undergraduate students should major in either physics, computer science, or electrical engineering. Students should also aim for a PhD in their chosen field and pursue a thesis related to quantum computing.</p>
