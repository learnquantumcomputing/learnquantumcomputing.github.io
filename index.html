	<h2>What is quantum computing?</h2>
	<p>Quantum computers use the phenomena of quantum physics and mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computers which perform computations with discrete binary states, quantum computers use superposition states of 0 or 1 to represent fundamental units of data. Superposition, along with entanglement and inteference, make up the quantum phenomena which allow quantum computers to excel in areas of computation such as cryptography, quantum simulation, optimization, and searching. </p>
